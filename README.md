# Exercise Tracker

Made from freeCodeCamp's boilerplate code for the Exercise Tracker project (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker).

You can see all users and their ID's by GETting "/api/users", and all the excercises of a specific user by GETting "/api/users/:_id/logs" (replacing :_id with the corresponding ID).

You'll need to add a valid MongoDB URI string as the MONGO_URI variable in the environment variables for it to work.

(Frontend is unmodified from the one provided by freeCodeCamp for testing)
